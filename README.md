# ScreenSaver
C# Screensaver, launching an external application while it's active.

----

It's pretty much it. This project is a screensaver, hacked together from samples of code, which launches any third-party application while showing a blank screen with a specified string on it.

The application is killed when the screensaver exits.

If the specified string is empty, current date and time are showed.

The project has been edited using MS Visual Studio 2012; the binary has been tested on Windows 7.
